## Hi there ðŸ‘‹. My name is Byron Benton and I have an affinity for creating. My specialties include data-driven product development, strategic decision-making and writing code. I love to learn new things and I'm always pushing my comfort level to get better each and every day. I currently know HTML, CSS and Javascript. My plan is to learn Python as well.
