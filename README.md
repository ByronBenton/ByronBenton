## Hello ðŸ‘‹. My name is Byron Benton and I have an affinity for creating. My specialties include data-driven product development, strategic decision-making and writing code. I push my comfort level in an attempt to get better each and every day. Currently, I'm familiar with HTML, CSS and JavaScript but my plan is to learn Python in the immediate future.
