##Hello ðŸ‘‹. My name is Byron.

As long as I remember my passion has always been in creating things. My specialties include data-driven product development, strategic decision-making and writing code. I push my comfort level in an attempt to get better each and every day. I would like to collaborate with like-minded people and add to the GitHub community.
